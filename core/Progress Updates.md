# What we have done this week

##### Coding work of Election Network related functionalities completed

##### Coding work of P2P Network completed: 

1.Election messages will be broadcast at a fixed time. When nodes receive these messages, they will get rid of duplicates, and add themselves to the globallist;

2.Refresh the globallist to remove those nodes going offline;

3.Block info as well as the globallist will be broadcast upon mining success; nodes will synchronize the globallist after receiving blocks.


# What we will do next week

##### Start the testing work on network
##### Make necessary improvements, such as verification on globallist
##### Use our unique crypto algorithms to caculate public keys based on signature value and plain text
##### Other testings
